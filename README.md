# Androidx-location-tracking
This code requests permission, handles permission denial, turns on location with prompt with its respective denials and finally tracks the location

This code doesn't entirely belong to me as the tracking part is taken from a StackOverflow answer on this thread

rest is coded by me

Well, you may delete some unwanted lines of views init. in onCreate, I was lazy to remove those, anyway that wont affect the functioning.
